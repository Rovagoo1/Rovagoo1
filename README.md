As an electrical engineer âš¡, I enjoy tinkering with electrical parts. I have enjoyed programming in Python for several years.
I'm aiming to enhance my software expertise while shifting my mindset towards embracing Agile software development practices and embracing Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### my plan
In order to learn Mircopython and to do this on a specific project, I am retrofitting my espresso machine Gaggia Classic (â˜•ðŸ˜Š). As a base I use the wonderful work of Zer0-bit, but with a Pi Zero.
